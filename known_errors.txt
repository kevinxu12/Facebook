If you get a cross origin error, this is because the backend is run on localhost8080 and the front end on 
localhost3000. To combat this, refer to the setupProxy.js file in the client/src folder


If when installing a package, if you get error along the lines of 'DTrace'. 
rm -rf node_modules
npm -i --no-optional 


To run the dynamo db stuff,
only call createtables once. If tables have not been created, uncomment the code out and build the tables.
Else if the tables are already made, don't call createtables. 

If a change is made to a schema and the table schema changes, delete the old table, and call create tables again.


Need to run app.js in one terminal window and npm start in another to get both front end and backend running at the same time.
